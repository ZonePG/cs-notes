### What is a Modality?

**Modality**: Modality refers to the way in which something expressed or perceived.

### What is Multimodal?

A dictionary definition: with multiple modalities.

A research-oriented definition: MultiModal is the science of heterogeneous and interconnected data.

### Heterogeneous Modalities

Information present in different modalities will often show diverse qualities, structures and representations.

Dimensions of Heterogeneity – Examples:
- Structure: static, temporal, spatial, hierarchical, invariances
- Representation space: discrete, continuous, interpretable
- Information: entropy, density, information overlap, range
- Granularity: sampling rate, resolution, precision
- Noise: uncertainty, signal-to-noise ratio, missing data
- Relevance: task relevance, context dependence

### Interconnected Modalities

- Connections
- Cross-modal interactions

Dimensions of Cross-modal Interactions:
- Additive, multiplicative, non-additive
- Bimodal, trimodal, high-modal
- Equivalence, correspondence, dependency
- Dominance, entailment, divergence
- Modulation, attention, transfer
- Causality, influences, directionality

### Prior Research in “Multimodal”

Four eras of multimodal research:
- The “behavioral” era (1970s until late 1980s)
  - language and Gestures
- The “computational” era (late 1980s until 2000)
  - Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR)
  - Multimodal/multisensory interfaces
  - Multimedia Computing
- The “interaction” era (2000 - 2010)
  - Modeling Human Multimodal Interaction: AMI Project, CHIL Project, CALO Project(Siri), SSP Project.
- **The “deep learning” era (2010s until ...)**
  - Main focus of this tutorial: last 5 years

## Multimodal Machine Learning

### What is Multimodal Machine Learning?

**Multimodal Machine Learning (ML)** is the study of computer algorithms that learn and improve through the use and experience of data from multiple modalities

**Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI)** studies computer agents able to demonstrate intelligence capabilities such as understanding, reasoning and planning, through multimodal experiences, and data

Multimodal AI is a superset of Multimodal ML

### Multimodal Technical Challenges – Surveys, Tutorials and Courses

![1-05](/MML-Tutorial/images/1-05.png)

### Challenge 1: Representation

**Definition**: Learning representations that reflect cross-modal interactions between individual elements, across different modalities

This is a core building block for most multimodal modeling problems!

### Challenge 2: Alignment

**Definition**: Identifying and modeling cross-modal connections between all elements of multiple modalities, building from the data structure

Most modalities have internal structure with multiple elements

### Challenge 3: Reasoning

**Definition**: Combining knowledge, usually through multiple inferential steps, exploiting multimodal alignment and problem structure

### Challenge 4: Generation

**Definition**: Learning a generative process to produce raw modalities that reflects cross-modal interactions, structure and coherence

### Challenge 5: Transference

**Definition**: Transfer knowledge between modalities, usually to help the target modality which may be noisy or with limited resources

### Challenge 6: Quantification

**Definition**: Empirical and theoretical study to better understand heterogeneity, cross-modal interactions and the multimodal learning process
